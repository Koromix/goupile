# Source code

This repository does not contain the code of Goupile but only exists as a front. For pratical reasons, I've started using a single repository for all my projects in 2018 because it is easier to manage.

The source code is available here: https://github.com/Koromix/rygel/ (in the *src/goupile* subdirectory).

Monorepositories have two killer features for me:

- Cross-project refactoring
- Simplified dependency management
