# Overview

Goupile is an **open-source electronic data capture application** that strives to make form creation and data entry both powerful and easy.

It is currently in development and there are no public builds yet. But you can find out more about it or [test the current alpha](https://demo.goupile.fr/) version online.

We also offer [paid hosting services](https://goupile.org/pricing) based on Goupile suited to your needs, see the pricing page or contact us for more information.

# Source code

This repository does not contain the code of Goupile but only exists as a front. For pratical reasons, I've started using a single repository for all my projects in 2018 because it is easier to manage.

The source code is available here: https://github.com/Koromix/rygel/ (in the *src/goupile* subdirectory).

Monorepositories have two killer features for me:

- Cross-project refactoring
- Simplified dependency management
